# 🎯 Guess the Number Game

A fun, interactive Python game where you challenge yourself to guess a randomly generated number! Test your intuition and aim for the leaderboard by guessing the number in the fewest tries. 🎉

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name.
3. Choose a range for the random number (e.g., 1 to 100).
4. Start guessing! Hints will guide you:
   - "Too high!" means your guess is above the target.
   - "Go higher!" means you're below the target.
5. Keep going until you guess correctly.
6. Your score (number of tries) will be recorded in the leaderboard. Can you top it?
